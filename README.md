# This is My C++ project

# What is this project about?

## This project is to record, analyse and develop my programming and logical skills using C++ and to contain all the algorithms that a programmer may need. also to add some functionality to it, their is a main file that calculate the time taken by an algorithm. and to execute it write the following command:
 `g++ ./sortalgo/sortalgo.hpp ./sortalgo/heapsort.cpp ./sortalgo/insertionsort.cpp ../misc/misc.hpp ../misc/misc.cpp  main.cpp`

# This project contains the following folders :-
 
  * ## Algorithm
  * ## Misc

# Algorithm folder

## This folder is storing various algorithms (specified by their folders) that are there in open (currently only sorting algorithms are present but much more would be added)

# Misc folder

## this folder contains many miscellaneous functions that may be required by a programmer but have no co-relation between them
