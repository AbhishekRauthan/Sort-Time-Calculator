# Sort Time Calculator

## this project is to calculate the time taken by various sorting algorithms like heapsort, insertion sort etc and produces the average time taken by each algorith.

## folder structure:
### there are 2 folders 
  * ### sortalgo
  * ### misc

### sortalgo folder contains all the sorting algorithms whereas misc folder contains all the functions that we may need but as such do not have any coorelation.

### use the following command in your cli for this to work(will be removed once makefile is working)
`g++ main.cpp ./sortalgo/heapsort.cpp ./sortalgo/insertionsort.cpp ./sortalgo/mergesort.cpp ./sortalgo/sortalgo.hpp ./sortalgo/quicksort.cpp  ./misc/misc.hpp ./misc/misc.cpp`
